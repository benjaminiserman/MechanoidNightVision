Mechanoids don't have regular meatbag eyes, so why shouldn't they be able to see in the dark? And plus: work mechs don't sleep; so clearly they should be designed to work at any time of day. This mod removes the global work speed penalty from low light for mechanoids.
		
This was a request from Auld on Ludeon Forums.
